2. Outlier Detection & Treatment: Identify and treat outliers using:
   - Mean & Standard Deviation
   - Percentile Method (5th and 95th percentile)
   - Interquartile Range (IQR)
   - Z-Score Method
3. Outlier Comparison: Compare the effectiveness of different outlier detection methods using box plots.
4. Normality Check: Evaluate the distribution of **price per square foot** using histograms and statistical metrics.
5. Transformations: Apply transformations (e.g., **log transformation**) if necessary to reduce skewness and kurtosis.
6. Correlation Analysis: Examine relationships between **numerical variables** using heatmaps and scatter plots.
7. Visualize Patterns: Utilize advanced visualizations to uncover insights.
